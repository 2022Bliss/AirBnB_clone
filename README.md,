Description
hbnb is a full-stack clone of the web application AirBnB. This clone was built in four iterative phases. This version includes completion of Phase 1, which has two parts: building 1) a command interpreter that parses and evaluates input from the commandline appropriately and 2) a landing page. Test suite included.

Part 1: Build a command-line interpreter that handles AirBnB objects
console

Part 2: Create a landing page

AirBnB_clone_v2: MySQL, Deploy static, Web framework
AirBnB_clone_v3: RESTful API
AirBnB_clone_v4: Web dynamic (Final version!)
Purpose
The purpose of Phase 1 is to:

create a parent class BaseModel that will take care of initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: instance <-> dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnb that inherit from BaseModel
create an abstracted storage engine (FileStorage)
create unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
create a command interpreter that can do the following:
create a new object
retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
do operations on objects
update attributes of an object
destroy an object
learn how to do the following:
create a Python package
create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
implement Unit testing on a large project
serialize and deserialize a class
write and read a JSON file
manage datetime
create UUIDs
use *args and **kwargs
handle named arguments in a function
create an HTML page
add complex CSS style to an element
Requirements
Must follow Betty style and document guidelines
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
Must have a README.md file
All header files must be include guarded
No more than 5 functions per files
Must have documentation
Must have unittests that can be executed using python3 -m unittest discover tests
